.. DocumentValidator documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

DocumentValidator is a tool to help a writer or programmer who writes technical documents or manuals that adheres to a writing standard. DocumentValidator automates the verfications of input documents written in natural languages (**NOT** computer languges such as C++ or Java). It works as the same way as `CheckStyle`_ , a famous code inspection tool for Java. Users add validators each of which checkes one aspect of the input document into the configuration file, and then following the configurations, this tool does the validation.

   This project is young, but I will update periodically as it is completed.
